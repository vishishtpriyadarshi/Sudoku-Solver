# Sudoku Solver


Sudoku Solver is a project to get sudoku solutions with just an image of your sudoku. 

This project is one which uses various techniques to get the job done. From finding the actual puzzle to be solved from the given image using computer vision techniques to applying deep learning tactics, this project is a melody of several other tools also.

It is a good source if you want to experiment out with our implementations and try to integrate various tools en lieu de working with them separately.

## Help Pages
Since we have used different techniques here, we have to tried to keep all of them different to improve the accuracy (for deep learning models) and efficiency (for solution and interface model) of this project. Hence for the each modules we have separate help pages for to help in understanding them. 

Following are the help pages available in the Wiki section:
- Image Processing with OpenCV Help 
- Convolution Neural Nets with Keras Help (coming soon...)
- Web App Develoment with NodeJS Help (coming soon...)
- Solving Algorithms Help (coming soon...)
